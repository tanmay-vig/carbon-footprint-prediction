# Carbon-Footprint-prediction project 

# Problem Statement
Despite increasing global awareness of climate change, most individuals lack a reliable and data-driven method to estimate their personal carbon footprint. Existing carbon calculators often rely on fixed assumptions, limited input parameters, or non-adaptive models that fail to capture real lifestyle variations. As a result, users receive generalized estimates that do not accurately reflect their true environmental impact. Moreover, the relationships between various lifestyle factors—such as transportation habits, energy usage, dietary patterns, and consumption behaviors—are complex and non-linear, making manual estimation inaccurate and inefficient.
There is a need for an intelligent system that can analyze diverse lifestyle data and provide accurate predictions of carbon emissions using machine learning techniques. This project aims to address this gap by developing a predictive model capable of learning patterns from historical data and identifying the most influential factors contributing to an individual’s carbon footprint. The solution should not only generate accurate predictions but also support environmental decision-making by highlighting key contributors to emissions.
